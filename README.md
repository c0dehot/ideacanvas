## Infoscape
A interactive tool that allows:
- people to see each other through webRTC (build over Jitsi)
- allows interactive co-work on learning tools (jsconsole, etc)
- will allow students to add notes and "replay" parts of the interactive experience
- allow students to form discussion groups within the tool.
- allow full extendibility by adding modules to the code
