## Moodscape
A moodscape screen to play with agenda and countdown for events

## MVP
For presenters that need to present class agenda and have a presenter screen. For those needing a way to show the progress in the days agenda, as well as a countdown timer till the end of a section for the day.

Keeping in mind this is a “moodscape”, the look of the screen should be relaxing. Actual elements needed are: background video (beach scene etc) or image, audio sound stream, and at least 2 widgets (countdown timer and agenda page).

# Programming Style
* camelCase with descriptive variables.
* 3-space indenting

} else {
   // branch false
}`
